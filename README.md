# Trax

Trax is a **reactive state management** library that simplifies and optimizes the update flow of [React] or [Preact] applications. Its purpose is similar to solutions like [redux], [mobx] or [preact signals].

Key features:
- **unique ids**: trax API design ensures that every trax object gets a unique id in order to support the best
troubleshooting experience through the trax dev tools (under construction)
- **asynchronous by design**: trax transformations (aka. compute processors) can run synchronous or asynchronous operations. Data updates are also propagated asynchronously in order to mutualize compute operations in case of consecutive changes.
- **event stream**: all trax operations are systematically logged in an event stream in oder to ease troubleshooting and simplify test synchronization (stream events can be awaited in test scripts).
- **collections**: support of complex reactive chains that involve computed collections (cf. examples)
