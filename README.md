# Trax

Trax is a reactive state management framework for web front-end developement.

Main benefits compared to other solutions:
- designed to provide the best troubleshooting experience through the trax dev tools (under construction)
- support of asynchronous and batched operations
- event stream allowing to synchronize tests and troubleshoot complex async transformations
- support of complex reactive chains including dynamic collections (cf. examples)
- limited set of concepts, minimal API and simple learning curve
- tests and TDD friendly
